from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
# Do I need to add models to `api/models.py`?

# It says

# ```python
# # Create your models here.
# ```

# but that's just boilerplate that Django made when the project was created. You
# can ignore it.

# All the models that matter are in `adventure/models.py`.
